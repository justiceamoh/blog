Hey there! 

I am Justice Amoh, a PhD candidate of the [Thayer School](http://thayer.dartmouth.edu/) at [Dartmouth College](http://dartmouth.edu/). I am a member of the [Thayer Analog Lab](http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/analoglab/) and my research interests are Machine Learning, Biomedical Devices and Acoustic Signal Processing. 

### Projects
Acoustic Health Sensors: Circuitry and machine learning algorithms for analyzing respiratory acoustics for detection and characterization of Asthma or COPD symptoms. 

BioImpedance: An embedded system extending a single chip  biopolar impedance analyzer IC to a tetrapolar device for applications in analyzing cancerous tissues during prostate biopsies.  

MHB: Methodist Hymn Book Android app for the Methodist Church, Ghana. An collation and indexing of all hymns, creeds, and service routines as available in the physical methodist hymn book used in all methodist churches in Ghana. Contributors: @andrewquartey, @edemsco.

Timely: An android app for Dartmouth students that anticipates what information user's need at any particular point in time, and delivers it to them in a Google-Now-cards kinda approach. Information includes current meal options at dining halls, events in buildings user might be in close proximity with, and so on. Collaborators: @deloschang, @talwai, @robinwang08

MyRuns: An activity tracking android app that automatically determines what activity user is engaged in, the duration of the activity and the amount of calories burned in that period. Also maps out the path taken on a google map.

TinySearchEngine: A small yet complete internet search engine comprising of a crawler, an indexer, and a query engine. Implemented as a class project.
