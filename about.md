Hey there! 

I am Justice Amoh and you have found my research blog. I am a PhD student at the [Thayer School of Engineering](http://thayer.dartmouth.edu/), [Dartmouth College](http://dartmouth.edu/) and a member of the [Analog Lab](http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/analoglab/). My research interests are Machine Learning, Biomedical Devices and Acoustic Signal Processing. In this blog, I aim to explore topics in electronics and machine learning that I have proven essential in my research. My motivation for this blog is embodied in the latin phrase:

> **Doscendo discimus**: *"by teaching, we learn"*.

It is my hope that by attempting to explore these subjects in a more simple and practical approach, I will provide a useful resource for beginners and at the same time gain a firmer grip on the material myself. Since I will be including code for everything I discuss on here, I also hope this blog will serve as a quick 'how-to' reference for myself or others in the future.

For more information about me and my work, visit my [Github](https://github.com/justiceamoh) or [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Justice_Amoh) profiles. I have worked on a wide variety of projects from instrumentation, through to smartphone apps. A few of these projects are:

- **DeepCough:** Deep neural networks for detecting cough sounds from a chest worn acoustic sensor 

- **Acoustic Health Sensors:** Circuitry and machine learning algorithms for analyzing respiratory acoustics for detection and characterization of Asthma or COPD symptoms. 

- **BioImpedance Device:** An embedded system extending a single chip biopolar impedance analyzer IC to a tetrapolar device for applications in analyzing cancerous tissues during prostate biopsies.  

- **MHB App:** Methodist Hymn Book Android app for the Methodist Church, Ghana. An collation and indexing of all hymns, creeds, and service routines as available in the physical methodist hymn book used in all methodist churches in Ghana. Contributors: @andrewquartey, @edemsco.

- **Timely App:** An android app for Dartmouth students that anticipates what information user's need at any particular point in time, and delivers it to them in a Google-Now-cards kinda approach. Information includes current meal options at dining halls, events in buildings user might be in close proximity with, and so on. Collaborators: @deloschang, @talwai, @robinwang08

- **MyRuns App:** An activity tracking android app that automatically determines what activity user is engaged in, the duration of the activity and the amount of calories burned in that period. Also maps out the path taken on a google map.

- **TinySearchEngine:** A small yet complete internet search engine comprising of a crawler, an indexer, and a query engine. Implemented as a class project.
